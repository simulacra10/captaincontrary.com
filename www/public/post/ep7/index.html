<h2 id="the-sinners-prayer">The Sinners Prayer</h2>
<p>Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.</p>

<h2 id="the-household-of-cornelius-acts-1044-48">The Household of Cornelius (Acts 10:44-48)</h2>
<p>44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</p>
<p>45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,</p>
<p>47 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</p>

<h3 id="chapter-61-christian-baptism">Chapter 61. Christian baptism</h3>
<p>I will also relate the manner in which we dedicated ourselves to God when we had been made new through Christ; lest, if we omit this, we seem to be unfair in the explanation we are making. As many as are persuaded and believe that what we teach and say is true, and undertake to be able to live accordingly, are instructed to pray and to entreat God with fasting, for the remission of their sins that are past, we praying and fasting with them. Then they are brought by us where there is water, and are regenerated in the same manner in which we were ourselves regenerated. For, in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the universe, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, they then receive the washing with water. For Christ also said, Unless you be born again, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. John 3:5 Now, that it is impossible for those who have once been born to enter into their mothers&rsquo; wombs, is manifest to all. And how those who have sinned and repent shall escape their sins, is declared by Esaias the prophet, as I wrote above; he thus speaks: Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from your souls; learn to do well; judge the fatherless, and plead for the widow: and come and let us reason together, says the Lord. And though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white like wool; and though they be as crimson, I will make them white as snow. But if you refuse and rebel, the sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it. Isaiah 1:16-20</p>
<p>And for this [rite] we have learned from the apostles this reason. Since at our birth we were born without our own knowledge or choice, by our parents coming together, and were brought up in bad habits and wicked training; in order that we may not remain the children of necessity and of ignorance, but may become the children of choice and knowledge, and may obtain in the water the remission of sins formerly committed, there is pronounced over him who chooses to be born again, and has repented of his sins, the name of God the Father and Lord of the universe; he who leads to the laver the person that is to be washed calling him by this name alone. For no one can utter the name of the ineffable God; and if any one dare to say that there is a name, he raves with a hopeless madness. And this washing is called illumination, because they who learn these things are illuminated in their understandings. And in the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and in the name of the Holy Ghost, who through the prophets foretold all things about Jesus, he who is illuminated is washed.</p>
<h3 id="isaiah-116-20">Isaiah 1:16-20</h3>
<p>16 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</p>
<p>17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</p>
<p>18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>
<p>19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</p>
<p>20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
