Friend, we need YOU to be the watchman on the wall. We need YOU to sound the alarm! Your children and your children&rsquo;s children need you to step up.

  The Sinners Prayer Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.
Paul gets baptized (Acts 9:18) Two requirements - REPENT &amp; BAPTISM (Acts 2:38) Acts 2:38: But Peter said to them: Do penance: and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins.

  On Episode 2 I discuss one of the fundamental changes to the government that altered the checks and balances that we are told about in school.
The 1929 Permanent Apportionment Act, formally known as the Reapportionment Act of 1929, is a pivotal piece of legislation in the history of the United States Congress. Here are the key points:

  On this first episode I talk about Trump and some people wanting to boogaloo and why I think that is the wrong response. I also read a portion of Gary North&rsquo;s article about the correct way to engage the State.
Pardon the terrible audio and speech. I am not used to doing this yet.
